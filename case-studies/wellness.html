            <h1>Flo - Wellness App Case Study</h1>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
              This project focuses on creating Flo, a wellness app designed to help individuals with ADHD or those on the lighter spectrum of neurodivergence. The app's primary goal is to empower users to manage their condition by fostering mindfulness and promoting self-care routines through a user-friendly digital tool.
Flo leverages user-centric design to address core challenges faced by neurodivergent individuals, focusing on one key aspect: improving focus and emotional regulation through guided breathing exercises, reminders, and motivational nudges.

              This solution focuses on helping people with ADHD or people who fall on the Neurodivergence spectrum, to manage their symptoms effectively and track their progress.
